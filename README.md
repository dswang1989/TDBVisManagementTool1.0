# TDBVisManagementTool1.0

----Name:
TDB visualized Management Tool

----Motivation:
Jena TDB is widely used to store tripes and RDF/OWL data. 
Since we did not find any visulized tool to manipulate jena TDB database, it is pretty unconvenient to check or look over the TDB we are dealing with. 

----Function:
1. Create or Load a TDB from local path.
2. Import RDF/OWL file into the TDB
3. Delete a named graph from the TDB
4. Use SPARQL to query and show result right in the panel
